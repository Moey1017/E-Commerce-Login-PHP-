Facebook Login
We implemented a Facebook login button to allow registered users to easily login with their Facebook accounts. https://github.com/facebookarchive/php-graph-sdk/tree/master/docs

Recaptcha Version 3
We implemented recaptcha to check that it was a user logging in instead of a bot. https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/intro

Forgot Password
We allowed the user to reset their password via the use of a secure token being emailed to their email address. 

Email
The website can email users to activate accounts and reset passwords. The email sent uses html for layout and css for style. https://www.hostgator.com/help/article/how-to-use-sendmail-with-php
